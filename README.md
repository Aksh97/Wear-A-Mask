## Wear A Mask : Rule Breaker Detection

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports suggest that one of the primary course of transmission of the COVID-19 infection is through respiratory droplets.
Respiratory droplets are generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes and any person in close range with the person is at a risk of being infected and that is the primary reason we have been advised to wear a mask by the World Health Organization. 

Thus, it is always important to wear a mask, not just for our safety, but for others. To ensure this the government has proposed several rules and regulations where in every person always must mandatorily wear a mask. This however, needs to be checked by an individual or authorities at all times which can be cumbersome. 

In order to simplify the process we plan to build a wear a mask : rule breaker detection system, where in every person is being monitored at all times at public places,like a shopping complex, and in case the person is seen without a mask , the person can be identified and traced down. In order to do that we have the following sub components like face detection , face recognition , mask detection and image enhancement.
